                <p>I was raised by my grandparents growing up in a small town in Ontario, Canada.
                   As long as I can remember all I wanted to do was join the army. By the time I
                   was old enough to join the army I had moved out to
                   western Canada to live with my father. The week after I graduated high school I
                   was sent off to do my training and begin my military career.  
                </p>
                <p>After years of training and domestic operations I was given an opportunity to go
                   to Australia and train with an Australian regiment. Shortly after ariving in Sydney
                    I met my future wife and from then on the plans of staying permanently started to form. 
                    I began working in construction as a scaffolder a career i really didnt plan on falling 
                    into,in this time we got married and had two dogs! and after eight years it is time I move
                     on to a career that is better for me mentaly and physically.
                 </p>
                 <p>I have always felt in myself a need to serve the community and perform a duty. The Army 
                   is behind me now and plans for a family are the new focus, A career in cyber security is my
                    goal in achieving both of these things. </p>
