### Objective

The purpose of this website is to introduce myself to potential employers and showcase a sample of my skills as a junior web developer.

### Content & Features

My website portfolio contains an example of my work as well as details about myself in four HTML based pages:

* The home page  acts as a directory as well as showcasing a reactive design.

* The about me page tells the reader where I come from and how I have come to this industry, along with some images to paint a better picture.

* The resume page is exactly that, it is my resume with links to my social media and a PDF of my resume itself.
  
* The blog page is purely to demonstrate my work with five blog posts and photos of my dogs in each. I added in a reactive "fun"box at the end for those who can't read latin.
